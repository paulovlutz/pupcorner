Pupcorner | Helping you find the pawfect friend in this pupcorner of the world!

Pupcorner was created as my Capstone Project in the Web Development Program (Spring Cohort 2020) at BrainStation, Toronto, Canada.

This web app helps people find nearby dogs available for adoption based on the traits they are looking for. 
To build this web app I used React on the front-end; Nodejs for the back-end, MySQL as my database, and a few third-party APIs to fetch the data.

You can see my presentation about this project on: https://www.loom.com/share/49087ffbef1847a68a207bd4de7b5155

Thank you!
